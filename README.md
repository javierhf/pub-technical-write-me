## About me

### My passion

**I'm passionate about crafting documentation** that helps people achieve their goals, transforming complex processes or technical concepts into clear, valuable, and actionable resources. With over 8 years of experience as a Technical Writer and Documentation Manager, I've discovered that great documentation isn't just about writing—it's about understanding the goals of your product, your team, and the language and needs of your audience, then building bridges between completeness, complexity, and clarity.

### My approach

I create and manage content for end-users and developers. My approach combines **empathy-driven communication**, **a** **lean mindset**, and **efficient GenAI tools to boost productivity**. At Mercedes-Benz.io, I managed documentation as a product, developed project roadmaps, set up regular feedback channels, optimized information architecture, and implemented CI/CD automations for quality assurance checks.

### What energizes me most?

Continuous learning, teamwork, the agile mindset, and hitting deadlines and reaching goals drives me. I'm currently diving deep into Python programming, API documentation, and GenAI tools for maximum efficiency. Whether it's implementing docs-as-code workflows, conducting user research to align content with users' real needs, or mentoring teams on best practices, I thrive in environments where technology meets human-centered communication.

I believe the best technical writers are translators—not just of language, but of ideas, processes, and innovations. Ready to transform your documentation strategy? Let's connect and explore how we can empower your users together.
