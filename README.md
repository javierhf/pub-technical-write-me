## About me

**I'm passionate about crafting documentation** that helps people achieve their goals, transforming complex processes or technical concepts into clear, valuable, and actionable resources. With over 8 years of experience as a Technical Writer and Documentation Manager, I've discovered that great documentation isn't just about writingâ€”it's about understanding the goals of your product, your team, and the language and needs of your audience, then building bridges between completeness, complexity, and clarity.

### My approach

I look at technical writing **documentation as a user-centric craft** built on the pillars of **empathy and communication, clarity, structure, and design**. In practice, I follow a four-phase workflow to treat documentation as a living product.

This process begins with **strategic communication and content planning**, where I identify key stakeholders, main friction points and challenges, and available resources to develop a project roadmap that aligns business objectives with user needs. I then move into the **creation and structuring** phase, applying a lean mindset and efficient workflows to transform complex information into simple, actionable guides, and reinforcing communication with all the involved parties.

The next phase, **refinement and validation**, involves developing a comprehensive quality assurance process, which includes implementing CI/CD automations (grammar, typos, style and links checks) and gathering user feedback through regular channels.&#x20;

Finally, the **delivery and maintenance** phase ensures long-term value by continuously optimizing information architecture, keeping documentation relevant as the product evolves, and supporting our users' success.

### What energizes me most?

**Continuous learning, teamwork, the agile mindset, hitting deadlines and reaching goals** drive me. I'm currently diving deep into Python programming, API documentation, and how to include GenAI tools in technical writing workflows efficiently. Whether it's implementing docs-as-code workflows, conducting user research to align content with users' real needs, or mentoring teams on best practices, I thrive in environments where technology meets human-centered communication.

We, technical writers, translate ideas, process, and innovations, crafting a whole reality for your people (our users) to succeed.
