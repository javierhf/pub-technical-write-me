# Technical-Write Me  

## Overview    

**Welcome to my [Technical Writer portfolio](https://javierhf.github.io/my-technical-writer-portfolio/)**, your place to read about technical writing and documentation project management.

Whether you're a technical writer or an IT professional needing some help with your documentation project, I hope you find this place useful.  

 ## What is Technical Writing?  
 
 **The Internet is full of concise and aseptic descriptions** that overlook the most important *ins and outs* of the job. From my experience I could tell that:  
 
 > Technical writing is a continuous learning process that equips you with all you need to create documentation that fulfills our users' needs, while also establishing effective communication and feedback channels to ensure your documentation are always aligned with your users' needs.

**That's exactly how it starts: by learning**. By learning the language and the needs of our readers we ca:   

* Ideate one solution (or more) to meet those needs. 
* Identify and describe all the required steps or subtasks to accomplish it.  
* Describe the subtasks of our solution, and then prioritize and plan.   
  
Once we have done that, creating and maintaining effective communication and feedback channels will ensure we are always aligned with our users' needs.

_Happy reading and documenting!_
