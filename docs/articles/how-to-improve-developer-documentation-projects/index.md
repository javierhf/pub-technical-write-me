## Introduction

**Developer Documentation is a curated set of files** **describing all the active workflows, setups, tools, conventions, best practices, and How-tos** of your software development product. Documentation supports your team members in their daily and future developments and helps new joiners reach cruise speed during the onboarding period.&#x20;

_But to do so, your documentation must be up-to-date and well-structured_.

**Keeping the docs in good shape requires resources and dedicated time**. Yet often our project time or budget constraints prevent us from taking care of our docs properly.

In the following sections, you will find a concise description of some steps you can take to start improving your documentation project.

## First Steps

**We can improve an existing documentation project from many perspectives**. The following steps represent the approach I've found more efficient in the middle and long term because it helps us to create _documentation awareness_ (steps 1 and 2) and aligns _user feedback_ (step 3) with our observations and ideas from the beginning.  &#x20;

### Step 1 - Create Documentation Awareness

**Creating documentation awareness is the continuous process by which we communicate the existence and importance** of the documentation project.  This communication craves _collaboration of teams and individuals (workmates)_ from all roles and seniority levels.&#x20;

**To communicate the existence and importance of a documentation project,** we need a communication plan to build the _documentation_ dedicated _meeting point._ A basic communication plan could include the following actions:



| Topic             | Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Communication** | <p></p><ul><li>Communicate the need for feedback and collaboration to all management roles and teams using it.</li><li>Create two dedicated chat channels for documentation updates and documentation support topics.</li><li>Shared meaningful and frequent documentation updates in the main chat channels.</li></ul> |
| **Training**      | <ul><li>Participate in onboarding processes.</li><li><p>Participate in cross-team meetings with documentation topics, for example:</p><ul><li>Good practices</li><li>Basic style guide</li><li>Effective communication</li><li>How to give feedback</li><li>Information Architecture</li></ul></li></ul>                |
| **Feedback**      | <ul><li>Create a survey to gather user feedback about different documentation aspects.</li><li>Run the user feedback once a year (at least).</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Step 2 - Create Your Improvement Project

**Look at your documentation project as a product because a product seeks success and needs to be managed to succeed**. Managing our documentation project as a product helps us to increase its visibility and cross-team awareness while supporting continuous improvement.&#x20;

**To manage our documentation as a product** using a _space_ (company Confluence, blog, etc.) to describe, visualize, and track the entire progress of the project. It also helps to radiate documentation good practices, documentation style guide, information architecture fundamentals, etc.

#### **Space Structure**

**The structure of an improvement project may differ** depending on your needs. Take the following _space_ structure as a reference that you can adapt to your needs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="214">Space Name</th><th width="166">Main Section</th><th width="187">Child Section</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>[Your Documentation ProjectÂ´s Name]</strong></td><td><em>N/A</em></td><td><em>N/A</em></td><td>Name of your documentation project.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Overview</strong></td><td></td><td>Explain briefly the What, Why and How of the documentation.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Dashboard</strong></td><td></td><td>Centralized page to easily access all project pages.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Analysis</strong></td><td></td><td>Media and results of documentation analysis.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Roadmap</strong></td><td></td><td>Visualization of the estimated dates to implement each improvement.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Project Development</strong></td><td><em>Communication Grid</em></td><td>Contact person by topic.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><em>Improvement Plan</em></td><td>Implementation phases and items.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><em>Coordination Meetings</em></td><td>Grid to align with your manager or collaborators (<em>Optional</em>).</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Once your improvement project space is set up,** you are ready to:

* Present it to all teams (including Product Owners and Scrum Masters).
* Track and show your progress.
* Visualize documentation issues/blocking points.
* Access all your project resources.

### Step 3 - Identify Your Documentation Issues

**Identifying your documentation issues means** spotting all the types of issues living among your docs. Some documentation issues are:

* Grammar, spelling, and syntax errors.
* Confusing/Not logical page structure.
* Unclear/Verbose text.

**For each type of documentation issue**, we can apply a specific fix strategy as shown in the following table:

<table><thead><tr><th width="312">Documentation Issue</th><th>Fix strategy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Grammar, spelling, syntax</strong></td><td>Use a text checker to support your writing. Some good options are <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> or <a href="https://quillbot.com/grammar-check">QuillBot</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Page structure</strong></td><td>Review your page structure. It shows the logical flow of the information contained according to the objective of the page, for example: <em>Introduction</em>, <em>Prerequisites</em>, <em>First Step</em>, <em>Working with.../Available Features</em>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Naming</strong></td><td>Define a naming strategy for page titles, sections and subsections.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Page elements</strong></td><td>Standardize the use of the following elements: lists, tables, tabs, notes, collapsible elements and images.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text unclear</strong> or <strong>too verbose</strong></td><td>Be concise.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Random text formatting</strong></td><td>Standardize the use of bold and italics for files, folder names, code snippets and code elements (functions, objects, methods, parameters, API names, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Too many topics on a single page</strong></td><td>Stick to "One topic per page".</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unnecessary screenshots</strong></td><td>Use screenshots or images <em>ONLY</em> when strictly necessary. If you can explain it briefly, do not use screenshots.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of notes</strong></td><td>Standardize each type of use case for notes (Info, Help, Warning, etc.).</td></tr></tbody></table>
