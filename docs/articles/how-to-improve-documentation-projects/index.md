### Introduction

**Developer Documentation is a curated set of files** **describing all the active workflows, setups, tools, conventions, best practices, and How-tos** of your software development product. Documentation supports your team members in their daily and future developments and helps new joiners reach cruise speed during the onboarding period.&#x20;

_But to do so, your documentation must be up-to-date and well-structured_.

**Keeping the docs up-to-date and in good shape requires resources and dedicated time**. Yet often our project time or budget constraints prevent us from taking care of our docs properly.

In the following sections, you will find a concise description of some steps you can take to start improving your documentation project.

### Step 1 - Create Awareness

**Creating documentation awareness** helps us to remember our colleagues the following:

* Our documentation aims to solve users' problems.
* We need frequent user feedback to improve our documentation.
* We need internal support and collaboration to improve our documentation widely.

**Help Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and all leading roles to understand** the importance of keeping good documentation.

### Step 2 - Organize Your Improvement Project

**Developer documentation has to be visible and easily accessible,** and your documentation has to be managed as a product to increase its visibility. To do so, keeping a _space_ (Confluence, company blog, etc.) to visualize, describe, and track your improvement project is a useful idea.

**Space Structure**

**The structure of an improvement project may differ** depending on your needs. Take the following _space_ structure as a reference that you can adapt to your needs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="214">Space Name</th><th width="166">Main Section</th><th width="187">Child Section</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>[Your Documentation ProjectÂ´s Name]</strong></td><td><em>N/A</em></td><td><em>N/A</em></td><td>Name of your documentation project.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Overview</strong></td><td></td><td>Explain briefly the What, Why and How of the documentation.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Dashboard</strong></td><td></td><td>Centralized page to easily access all project pages.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Analysis</strong></td><td></td><td>Media and results of documentation analysis.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Roadmap</strong></td><td></td><td>Visualization of the estimated dates to implement each improvement.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>Project Development</strong></td><td><em>Communication Grid</em></td><td>Contact person by topic.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><em>Improvement Plan</em></td><td>Implementation phases and items.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><em>Coordination Meetings</em></td><td>Grid to align with your manager or collaborators (<em>Optional</em>).</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Once your improvement project space is set up,** you are ready to:

* Present it to all teams (including Product Owners and Scrum Masters).
* Track and show your progress.
* Visualize documentation issues/blocking points.
* Access all your project resources.

### Step 3 - Identify Your Documentation Issues

**Identifying your documentation issues means** spotting all the types of issues living among your docs. Some documentation issues are:

* Grammar, spelling, and syntax errors.
* Confusing/Not logical page structure.
* Unclear/Verbose text.

**For each type of documentation issue**, we can apply a specific fix strategy as shown in the following table:

<table><thead><tr><th width="312">Documentation Issue</th><th>Fix strategy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Grammar, spelling, syntax</strong></td><td>Use a text checker to support your writing. Some good options are <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> or <a href="https://quillbot.com/grammar-check">QuillBot</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Page structure</strong></td><td>Review your page structure. It shows the logical flow of the information contained according to the objective of the page, for example: <em>Introduction</em>, <em>Prerequisites</em>, <em>First Step</em>, <em>Working with.../Available Features</em>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Naming</strong></td><td>Define a naming strategy for page titles, sections and subsections.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Page elements</strong></td><td>Standardize the use of the following elements: lists, tables, tabs, notes, collapsible elements and images.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text unclear</strong> or <strong>too verbose</strong></td><td>Be concise.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Random text formatting</strong></td><td>Standardize the use of bold and italics for files, folder names, code snippets and code elements (functions, objects, methods, parameters, API names, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Too many topics on a single page</strong></td><td>Stick to "One topic per page".</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unnecessary screenshots</strong></td><td>Use screenshots or images <em>ONLY</em> when strictly necessary. If you can explain it briefly, do not use screenshots.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of notes</strong></td><td>Standardize each type of use case for notes (Info, Help, Warning, etc.).</td></tr></tbody></table>
