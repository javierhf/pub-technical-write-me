## Overview

**Product development project benefits from having good and effective documentation.** A documentation set is _good_ when it covers all the topics our users and customers require, and it is _effective_ when it provides content that is _easy to find_, easy to understand, and easy to act upon, while being complete according to all the known contexts of use.&#x20;

However, we all know that budget constraints too often get in the way, becoming an obstacle to hire the dedicated role we need: a technical writer.

**This article offers an easy-to-handle Swiss knife** to manage and improve your documentation project when you can afford a technical writer.

## Prerequisites



{% hint style="info" %}
Involve management and technical roles to improve your documentation project
{% endhint %}

* [x] Involvement and direct communication with management roles.
* [x] Save a small slot of time for documentation work.

## Technical Documentation Swiss-Knife

**The swiss-knife to manage and improve documentation projects** includes the following set of basic ideas (blades):

1. Know Your Ground.
2. Know Your Documentation Needs.
3. Prioritize and Plan.
4. Commit to your documention.

### Blade 1 - Know Your Ground

**Know your ground before taking any further step.** Knowing your ground means to:

> * know the deficiencies of your documentation,&#x20;
> * identify what is preventing it from being useful, and effective.

**To know your ground you need to analyse your documentation** from different perspective. Consider the following checklist and ticked the ones you have covered:

* [ ] My documentation provide content for all the topics my users need to know
* [ ] My documentation pages tells users:

> * _what is the page about,_
> * _what they can do,_
> * _how to do it,_
> * _who to ask for help._

* [ ] My documentation informs about _prerequisites_ (if any)
* [ ] My documentation provides all the required information for the specific user case/type of page
* [ ] My documentation is clear, specific and concise (no verbose)
* [ ] There is a clear workflow to gather feedback, review and update the documentation
* [ ] My documentation architecture mirrors the workflow of regular users



{% hint style="warning" %}
**The items you have not ticked** are the ones you need to tackle.
{% endhint %}

Knowing your ground can be a terrifying experience leaving in a hopeless-like state of mind. But despair do not! Be patient, take small steps. Then _iterate!_

### Blade 2 - Know Your Documentation Needs

**If the Oracle of Delphi had managed documentation,** it might have said:

> "Know your documentation needs."

**Knowing your documentation needs helps you to contextualize** the insights you've gained from the previous checklist.

**To know our documentation needs** answer the following questions:

* Do I have a clear and coherent writing style for my documentation?
* Do I need to increase clarity?
* Do I just need to reduce verbosisty?
* How often do I need to review and update my documentation?
* Who can review the documentation updates?
* Who can ensure the correctness of the documentation?
* Do I have communication channels for my users to provide feedback?
* What is the _minimum viable and valuable documentation_ for my project/product?

Once you answer these questions, you'll be ready to _prioritize and plan_ your documentation effort.

### Blade 3 - Prioritize and Plan your Documentation Effort

**Every project is different,** but knowing your ground and your documentation needs increases the chances of having a successful documentation project. With these new insights, you can now prioritize and plan.

**To prioritize your documentation efforts** you need to to identify the most critical topic/issue, and the most valuable topic/issue. Then decided where to start with depending on your product's priorities and needs.

**Starting with the most critical** topic means that you will _address the topic which is the most critical to develop your product_ in the first place.

**Starting with the most valuable** topic means that you will _address the topic that provides more value to your customer or project_ in the first place.

**Once you have prioritize what to start improving or managing** create a roadmap or a prioritize backlog to track and update your progress.



{% hint style="warning" %}
Consider the most critical topica and the most valuable, depending on your product, project and business objective
{% endhint %}

### Blade 4 - Commit to Your Documentation



{% hint style="info" %}
Involve management and technical roles to improve your documentation project
{% endhint %}

**Now that you know your ground and your needs, and after prioritizing**, it is time to commit to your documentation. Only then you'll be able to improve and manage your documentation actively and regularly.

**To support you commitment** the following tips may help you:

1. Save a slot of time to manage/improve your documentation on a weekly basis.
2. Create an automatic reminder (Outlook, Calendar, GitHub Actions, Slack, Teams, etc).
3. Involve other team members.
4. Inform management roles about the importance of the documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting a reminder in Outlook or using a script or GitHub Actions is really helpful
{% endhint %}

## Bonus Information

If you are reading this article, you probably don't have much time to search, read and implement style guides and good practices. Don't worry, in the following table I share with you some fundamentals of documentation writing you can learn and apply easily:
