## Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) for Documentation Projects

**It seems simple but applying the SRP to documentation projects requires a little change** in the product team's mindset:  

* Now they will provide the information  
* The technical writes will create the content  

### Key Concepts  

**Applying the SRP to documentation projects** requires the key concepts described in the following table:   


| Concept | Description |  
|------------- | ------------------- |  
| **Information** |	<ul><li>Information consists of all pieces of text, screenshots and raw data provided by collaborators.</li><li>Pieces of text can be introduction, process steps, features, and code descriptions (library, parameters, snippets, endpoints, etc).</li><li>Pieces of text are provided as a draft with a basic structure.</li></ul>|  
| **Content** |	Content is the information after being standardized. Standardized information reflects the style guide and the technical writing best practices. |  
| **Shared Ownership** | Every page is the result of team collaboration, so the team owns the documentation. |  

**Keeping this concepts in mind** we can define the following roles and their responsibilities:  

| Role | Responsibility |  
| ------------- | --------------- |    
| **Collaborators** | Provide information which:<ol><li> is correct</li><li>is in the right order</li><li>is in the right context.</li></ol> |  
| **Reviewers** |	Validate the information provided by collaborators when required.|  
| **Technical Writer** | <ol><li>Converts information into content.</li><li>Manages release process.</li><ol> |    

## Conclusion

**This is the new mindset: assigning a limited and specific set of tasks**, for all the roles participating in the documentation workflow, to ensure we all add value where we have to.  

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for documentation projects changes the idea of documentation ownership. We will not have _individual ownership_ anymore but an idea of _shared ownership_.   

Now that all the documentation roles contribute to the final documentation: _we all own the docs!_.  

This idea of _shared ownership_ may be not easy to accept for everyone but the technical writer can reduce any possible friction with an effective communication strategy.
