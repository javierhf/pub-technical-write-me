## Additional Notes

**Tutorials are educational and are designed to teach users new skills or knowledge.** They are ideal for beginners or those new to a topic. Tutorials often have a broader scope, provide foundational understanding, and include comprehensive explanations. They are structured in a way that builds understanding step by step.

**How-to Guides are more practical and task-oriented.** They are meant for users who need clear, concise instructions to achieve a specific goal or solve a specific problem. How-to guides are typically focused on a single task or problem, making them more suitable for users with some existing knowledge or experience who don't need extensive background information.
