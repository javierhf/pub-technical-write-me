## Overview  
  
>“How-to guides are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. How-to guides are goal-oriented.”, a definition from the Diátaxis framework.

**How-to guides are practical documents that are designed and written with a “user at work” in mind.** The characteristics of how-to guides are the following:
  
* Assume users have some previous knowledge about the task to complete   
* Lead users to complete real-world specific tasks successfully   
* Disclose all the required steps in sequence, addressing key scenarios   
* Provide (if necessary) useful information to prepare users for the unexpected within the context of the task  


## Real-world Actions  

**How-to guides seek users’ success. They provide structured steps to offer a safe path for users to move in the real world.** However, the real world is unpredictable, and there may be specific situations or contexts that fall outside the key scenarios or that are still unknown. 

How-to guides might *account for different versions of an operating system*, the *most common package managers*, and a *standard set of user permissions*. However, it will not cover users’ personal work environment configurations or the company’s security policies that manage resource access, installation, or execution. 

**How-to guides presume users already possess the knowledge to handle unexpected situations** in a given context, for a sequence of steps. This knowledge is not limited to technical or task-related knowledge but also includes an understanding of their work environment. 

This is why, when following a how-to guide, users are responsible for addressing unexpected situations.
