## Overview  

**Tutorials are a learning-oriented documentation type that encloses practical knowledge** to allow users to learn about a very specific and first-level topic required, for example, before starting working with a product or platform. 

**Tutorials are lessons that:**

> _”must help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product so that they can go on to use the product for their purposes.”_

**Tutorials turn new learners into users** and, because of that, are entitled to the “glorious purpose” of providing a first successful experience of the product.   

**To do so, tutorials have to provide:**

* A complete overview of the expected result
* Meaningful information
* Steps to succeed that:
> * are specific and complete,
> * appear in the right order,
> * come in the right context.

## A learning Experience  
  
**Tutorials are learning-oriented so they provide a learning experience** that _MUST_ avoid extensive explanations, abstractions, and generalizations, and present choices and information. In other words, _tutorials are lessons with a teacher and a learner_. 

Teacher and learner have their specific responsibilities. The teacher writes the tutorial and commits to showing just the required instructions for the learner to succeed. The learner has to do as instructed.

**After completing a tutorial,** users should see results immediately and “be able to start to make sense of the rest of the documentation and the product itself”.
