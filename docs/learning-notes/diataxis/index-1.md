# Tutorials

> **What this notes cover**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x4D;y learning notes about tutorials in the_ [_Diátaxis_](https://diataxis.fr/) _documentation framework._

## Overview

**Tutorials are a learning-oriented documentation type.** T**utorials enclose practical knowledge to allow users to learn about a very specific and first-level topic**. Tutorials are lessons that:

> _”must help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product so that they can go on to use the product for their purposes.”_

**Tutorials turn new learners into users** and, because of that, are entitled to the “glorious purpose” of providing a first successful experience of the product. To do so, tutorials have to provide:

* A complete overview of the expected result
* Meaningful information
* Steps to succeed that:

> - Are specific and complete
> - Appear in the right order
> - Come in the right context

## Characteristics

**Tutorials are learning-oriented so they provide a learning experience.** This learning experience _MUST_ avoid:&#x20;

* Extensive explanations, abstractions, and generalizations
* Present choices and information

**In other words, tutorials are lessons** _with a teacher and a learner, each of them with_ their specific responsibilities:

* The teacher writes the tutorial and commits to showing just the required instructions for the learner to succeed.&#x20;
* The learner has to do as instructed.

**After completing a tutorial, users should see results immediately** and “be able to start to make sense of the rest of the documentation and the product itself”.
