# Tutorials or How-to Guides

> **What this notes cover**\
> _My checklist (draft) to distinguish between tutorials and how-to guides applying the_ [_Diátaxis_](https://diataxis.fr/) _documentation framework._

## Overview

**To distinguish a tutorial from a How-to guide** we need to think about the following document aspects:

* _Goal orientation_
* _User's prior knowledge_
* _Scope and depth_
* _Format and structure_
* _Result_
* _Level of detail_
* _Examples and practical application_

In the following section, you will find a table to help you identify if your document or draft is a tutorial or a checklist.&#x20;

## Tutorial or How-To Guide? A Checklist

**For each of the following documentation aspects** select the sentence that best describes your document or draft:

<table><thead><tr><th>Documentation Aspect</th><th>Document Description</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Goal Orientation</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>The primary purpose of the document is to guide the user through a series of steps to achieve a broader understanding or a comprehensive goal.</li><li>The primary purpose of the document is to solve a specific, practical problem or to accomplish a specific task?</li></ol></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>User's Prior Knowledge</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>The document is designed for beginners or users with limited prior knowledge of the subject?</li><li>The document is meant for users with some understanding or experience who need specific instructions.</li></ol></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scope and Depth</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>The document covers a wide scope, providing a general understanding of a topic or tool.</li><li>The document focused on a narrow topic, aiming for depth in a specific area.</li></ol></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format and Structure</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>The document follows a linear, step-by-step structure, possibly spanning multiple sessions or modules.</li><li>The document is a standalone piece, providing straightforward steps that can be followed in one sitting.</li></ol></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>End Goal</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>The end goal of the document is to educate the user providing a foundational understanding.</li><li>The end goal of the document is to enable the user to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.</li></ol></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level of Detail</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>Does it include detailed explanations and background information?<br>(<em>Tutorial</em>)</li><li>Does it focus on delivering concise, action-oriented instructions?<br>(<em>How-to</em>)</li></ol></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Examples and Practical Application</strong></td><td><p></p><ol><li>The document includes examples to illustrate a process or concept in a broader learning context.</li><li>The document provides practical examples or scenarios specifically tailored to executing a task.</li></ol></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



### Analyzing Your Selections

**Depending on how many times you have selected 1 or 2** your document will likely fit either a _Tutorial_ or a _How-to_ type of documentation:

* _If 1 is your selection for all documentation aspects,_ then your document is a [Tutorial](index-1.md).
* _If 2 is your selection for all the documentation aspects,_ then your document is a [How-to](how-tos/index.md) guide.&#x20;

**However, if you have selected 1 and 2,**  you may need to _refine your documentation draft_ and _reassess your documentation needs_.
