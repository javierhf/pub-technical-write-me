## Overview   

**[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is a lightweight documentation authoring framework that is straightforward to apply and that does not impose implementation constraints.** The goal of [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is to improve documentation quality by describing an information architecture (types of documents) that emerges from a systematic understanding of the needs of the documentation users.   

## User Needs and Types of Documentation

**[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) groups user needs under four scopes** and describes four different types of documentation:     

|Scope | User Needs | Type of Documentation |  
| ----------- |------ | ----------- |  
| **Learning** | Users needs to learn about a specific topic before doing anything else. |  _Tutorials_ |
| **Task-oriented** | Users need to perform a specific task successfully. | _How-to guides_ | 
| **Understanding-oriented** | Users need to understand high-level concepts, ideas, processes, or a specific context before learning about other topics or performing any specific task. |  _Explanation_ |
| **Reference** | Users need a source of information as a reference for all the tasks and the required working contexts. |  _References_ |  

**Each type of documentation fulfills a different purpose and requires a specific approach** to develop its content.
