# Two Common Misconceptions that Threaten Your Product Success: "Updated" and "Consistent"

The story surely sounds familiar—the well-meaning product owners, stakeholders, or team members who reduce documentation to simple checkboxes: _"Is it updated?"_ and _"Is it consistent?"_

I understand why this happens. **Product Owners and executives juggle competing priorities, sprint deadlines, and stakeholder demands**. When documentation becomes just another item on an overloaded backlog, **it's tempting to reduce it to quick, measurable checkboxes**. But these questions, while not wrong, represent a limited and dangerous understanding of documentation work and of what makes documentation truly valuable.

If you, as a Technical Writer, have witnessed firsthand how those deficits work, you know how they undermine not just documentation quality, but ultimately product success. Let me be clear: **oversimplified documentation thinking and the absence of a documentation strategy directly penalize your product's users and your product's success**. This isn't a documentation problem—it's a business problem.

It's worth remembering that **technical writing is a collaborative effort** that greatly depends on how receptive Product Owners are to our insights and recommendations, and their ability to clearly communicate documentation priorities. When this communication fails or doesn't exist, creating effective documentation becomes significantly harder—if not impossible.

### The Fallacy: "Updated = Valuable"

_"The documentation is updated, so it's good."_ This limited mindset treats documentation like a Wikipedia page—as long as the documentation reflects the latest product updates (new features are mentioned, outdated screenshots are replaced, and version numbers are updated) the job is done: _"We have met our commitment to the client."_

Here's the reality: **this approach fails to tackle the human experience of using documentation and the realities of documentation work**. Updated information that's poorly organized, hard to find, and difficult to understand or act upon isn't just useless—it actively damages your product's reputation. The information might be technically correct, but it fails functionally, and your users will judge your entire product by this failure.

**The real impact?** When documentation is merely "updated" without considering usability, users experience:

* **Cognitive overload** from information dumps without clear hierarchies
* **Task failure** when they can't find relevant information quickly
* **Frustration** that leads to increased support tickets and reduced product adoption
* **Abandonment** when the learning curve becomes too steep

### The Trap: "Consistency = Uniformity"

_"All headings should be the same style_. _All buttons should be described the same way. All pages should follow the same template."_ This mechanical approach to consistency treats documentation like a style guide checklist.

**Effective and user-centered consistency** in documentation isn't about making everything look the same—**it's about creating predictable, logically structured experiences** that reduce cognitive load, guide users to the information they need, and **make** informed decisions about when to break patterns for the user's benefit.

At a minimum, **it requires Product Owners to communicate business objectives and documentation priorities to technical writers**, enabling them to develop a documentation strategy (including consistency review and implementation) that serves both users and business needs. This communication empowers technical writers to make informed decisions while supporting our product's success.

**Superficial uniformity  and the absence of documentation strategy harm both your technical writer's effectiveness and your users' experience**. When there is no documentation strategy, your technical writer must make decisions in the dark, unable to address documentation issues systematically—while managing significant frustration when the documentation is in terrible condition.

**The real impact?** Your users will suffer from and pay the costs of:

* Unclear content hierarchy when each page differs despite similarities
* Dysfunctional templates that don't match their mental models
* Confusing content that doesn't support their goals
* Poor information design that makes nothing easy to find, understand, or act upon

### The Hidden Costs of Absent Documentation Strategy

I know that documentation strategy often gets deprioritized or its benefits are even ignored. There are always more features to build, bugs to fix, and revenue targets to hit. But here's what that trade-off actually costs our product and business:

> When documentation is created and maintained but doesn't serve your product's users, it becomes a barrier to product adoption rather than an enabler. Users who can't quickly understand and use your product will seek alternatives, regardless of how "updated" or "consistent" your docs appear. Period.

> An absent documentation strategy creates a direct pipeline to customer support. Every confusing explanation, every hard-to-find answer, every task that users can't complete independently becomes a barrier to conversion and renewal, directly penalizing your sales.

The same applies to internal or project documentation. Your team will suffer when the documentation they rely on to do their jobs fails to effectively communicate product decisions, feature requirements, or technical specifications. Development cycles slow down as teams spend time re-clarifying and re-communicating.&#x20;

In markets where multiple products offer similar features, **documentation planning directly impacts product quality and adoption. It is a differentiator.** Users choose products they can understand and implement successfully. Users cancel licenses of products whose documentation stands between them and their success.

### What Real Documentation Planning and Documentation Value Looks Like

#### User-Centered Design

**Documentation planning starts with mapping current documentation issues and how to fix them**, then continues by prioritizing fixes while aligning business goals with user insights. Valuable documentation begins with understanding who will use it, what they're trying to accomplish, and what obstacles they face.&#x20;

This means conducting **user research**, **creating personas**, and **designing information architecture around user goals** rather than internal product structure. Then: implement, test, and iterate!

#### Strategic Consistency

Professional consistency means **making deliberate choices about when and how to implement and maintain patterns**. It's about creating systems that serve user comprehension, not just visual uniformity, while ensuring that every sprint releases value for users. This includes:

* **Semantic consistency** in how concepts are explained across different contexts
* **Structural consistency** in how similar types of information are organized
* **Functional consistency** in how interactive elements behave

#### Performance Measurement

**Real documentation value is measurable through metrics** like task completion rates, time-to-comprehension, user satisfaction scores, and reduction in support tickets. These metrics reveal whether documentation actually helps users succeed. We can start small, for instance, measuring our product's onboarding process. Then: implement, test, and iterate!

### Questions That Matter

Instead of asking _"Is it updated?"_ and _"Is it consistent?"_, product teams must ask:

* Can users find the information they need when they need it?
* Do users understand how to apply this information to their specific context?
* Are we reducing the cognitive load required to use our product?
* How does this documentation choice serve our users' mental models?
* What evidence do we have that this documentation actually helps users succeed?

### The Path to Documentation Strategy

**Recognizing these misconceptions is the first step toward building documentation that truly serves users and drives product success**. It requires moving beyond superficial metrics toward deeper understanding of user needs, information design principles, and strategic communication.

The goal isn't just to maintain documentation—it's to **create an information experience that empowers users to achieve their goals efficiently and confidently**. When we get this right, documentation becomes not just a product necessity, but a competitive advantage.
