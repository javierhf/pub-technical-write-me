# Two Common Misconceptions that Threaten Your Product Success: "Updated" and "Consistent"

The story surely sounds familiar—the well-meaning product owners, stakeholders, or team members who reduce documentation to simple checkboxes: _"Is it updated?"_ and _"Is it consistent?"_ **While these questions aren't wrong, they represent a dangerous shortage of documentation work understanding** and of what makes documentation truly valuable. It's a warning sign.

If you, as Technical Writer, have witnessed firsthand how those deficits work, you know how **they undermine not just documentation quality, but ultimately product success**. To put it simply, _oversimplified documentation thinking and the absence of a documentation strategy penalizes your product's users and your product's success_.

## The Fallacy: "Updated = Valuable"

_"The documentation is updated, so it's good."_ Does it sound familiar? **This limited mindset treats documentation like a Wikipedia page**—as long as the documentation reflects the latest product updates (new features are mentioned, outdated screenshots are replaced, and version numbers are updated) the job is done: _"We have met our commitment to the client."_

However, **this approach completely ignores the human experience of using documentation and the realities of documentation work**. What's the use of updated information if it is poorly organized, hard to find, and difficult to understand or action? The information might be correct, but it's functionally useless and your product's users will have a poor image of your product.

**The real impact?** When documentation is merely "updated" without considering usability, users experience:

* **Cognitive overload** from information dumps without clear hierarchies
* **Task failure** when they can't find relevant information quickly
* **Frustration** that leads to increased support tickets and reduced product adoption
* **Abandonment** when the learning curve becomes too steep

## The Trap: "Consistency = Uniformity"

_"All headings should be the same style. All buttons should be described the same way. All pages should follow the same template."_ Sound familiar? **This mechanical approach to consistency treats documentation like a style guide checklist**.

But **true consistency** in documentation isn't about making everything look the same—**it's about creating predictable, logically structured experiences** that reduce cognitive load and guide users to find the information they need consistently and making informed decisions about when to break patterns for the user's benefit.&#x20;

At minimum, **it means developing a documentation strategy** (including consistency review and implementation) that allows your technical writer to make informed decisions while addressing both business/team and users' needs.

**Blind uniformity and ignoring the importance of designing a documentation strategy harm your technical writer's work and your users' experience**. When there is no documentation strategy, your technical writer has to make decisions in the dark without knowing what to do when documentation issues emerge —while dealing with a great and unnecessary degree of frustration if the documentation is in a real bad condition.&#x20;

**Blind uniformity and ignoring the importance of designing a documentation strategy** condemn your product's users to:

* **Not finding a clear content hierarchy** when each page is different no matter what similitudes between them
* **Being forced to scroll dysfunctional/inappropriate templates** that don't match the user's mental models
* **Dealing with confusing content** that does not support their goals
* **Empty appearance** that does not make information easy to find, understand and action upon

## The Hidden Costs of Absent Documentation Strategy

When documentation is created and maintained and yet does not serve our product's users, it becomes a barrier to product adoption rather than an enabler. And users who can't quickly understand and use your product will seek alternatives, regardless of how "updated" or "consistent" your docs appear.

An absent documentation strategy creates a direct pipeline to customer support. Every confusing explanation, every hard-to-find answer, every task that users can't complete independently becomes a barrier to conversion and renewal, directly penalizing your sales.

The same happens with internal or project documentation. Won't your team suffer if the internal documentation, if the documentation they have to rely on to do their job doesn't effectively communicate product decisions, feature requirements, or technical specifications? Development cycles slow down as teams spend time re-clarifying and re-communicating. Bugs start to breed.

In markets where multiple products offer similar features, documentation planning supports product quality and adoption. It becomes a differentiator! Users choose products they can understand and implement successfully. Users cancel licenses of products which documentation stands between them and their success.

## What Real Documentation Planning and Documentation Value Looks Like

**User-Centered Design**

Documentation planning starts with mapping the current documentation issues we have, how to fix them; then, it continues by prioritizing the fixes, aligning business goals and user insights. Valuable documentation starts with understanding who will use it, what they're trying to accomplish, and what obstacles they face. This means conducting user research, creating personas, and designing information architecture around user goals rather than internal product structure. Then, start, implement, test, and iterate!

**Strategic Consistency**

Professional consistency means making deliberate choices about when and how to implement and maintain patterns steadily. It's about creating systems that serve user comprehension, not just visual uniformity, while ensuring that every sprint releases value for users. This includes:

* Semantic consistency in how concepts are explained across different contexts
* Structural consistency in how similar types of information are organized
* Functional consistency in how interactive elements behave

**Performance Measurement**

Real documentation value is measurable through metrics like task completion rates, time-to-comprehension, user satisfaction scores, and reduction in support tickets. These metrics reveal whether documentation actually helps users succeed.

## <sub>Question That Matter</sub>

Instead of asking "Is it updated?" and "Is it consistent?", product teams should ask:

* Can users find the information they need when they need it?
* Do users understand how to apply this information to their specific context?
* Are we reducing the cognitive load required to use our product?
* How does this documentation choice serve our users' mental models?
* What evidence do we have that this documentation actually helps users succeed?

## <sub>The Path to Documentation Strategy</sub>

Recognizing these misconceptions is the first step toward building documentation that truly serves users and drives product success. It requires moving beyond superficial metrics toward deeper understanding of user needs, information design principles, and strategic communication.

The goal isn't just to maintain documentation—it's to create an information experience that empowers users to achieve their goals efficiently and confidently. When we get this right, documentation becomes not just a product necessity, but a competitive advantage.
