# Understanding API Documentation

Last year, in 2024, I started learning about (REST) API documentation partly out of pure curiosity, partly as a way to extend my technical writing knowledge. I completed the [I'd Rather Be Writing - API doc course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) in both its written and [youtube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NawxzLB4aro) formats, then dove directly into the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). But I still felt that something was missing: the coding part! So I jumped to learn the basics of API coding in Python, enough to build a **conceptual bridge between API documentation theory, OpenAPI specification, and actual code**. It was enlightening to finally connect core API concepts (_endpoints_, _methods_, _requests/responses_, _data schemas_, _HTTP error codes_) with real code, specifications, and documentation.

Still, the **division of API documentation into "conceptual" and "reference" documentation** remained confusing to me. Reference documentation made sense—it's the comprehensive content for deeper system integration. But why call the practical, enablement-focused sections "conceptual"? Why not _"Hands-on documentation"_ or _"Enablement documentation"_?&#x20;

Looking at real API docs from various companies helped me realize that beyond reference documentation, **companies give different names to their API documentation sections** and offer getting started guides and tutorials—the truly practical stuff.

Now that I'm reviewing my own API documentation samples, I decided to share the framework that helped me connect theory with practice. It cleared up my confusion and gave me a better way to think about API documentation structure. I hope you find it helpful too.
