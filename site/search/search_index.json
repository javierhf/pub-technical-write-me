For example, you can exclude parts of the data you don't need with the exclude parameter in the One Call API 3.0. Respect API Limits Be aware of your subscription plan's API call limits and ensure your application does not exceed them. Implement logic to throttle requests if necessary. Use Units and Language Parameters Customize API responses for your audience by using the units parameter to specify temperature and wind speed units, and the lang parameter to localize weather descriptions. Geocoding Use the Geocoding API to convert between city names and geographical coordinates when necessary, as direct requests by city name may be deprecated for some endpoints. Subscription Management Keep track of your subscription status and the features available to you. Some features, like the One Call API 3.0, require a separate subscription. Stay Updated <p>OpenWeather periodically updates its APIs and documentation. Stay informed about any changes that might affect your application by regularly checking the OpenWeather website or subscribing to their updates.</p><p></p>"},{"location":"my-portfolio/api-docs/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":""},{"location":"my-portfolio/api-docs/#a","title":"A","text":"<ul> <li>API Key: A unique identifier required to authenticate requests to the OpenWeather API.
